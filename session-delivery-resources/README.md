## The following resources are intended for a presenter to learn and deliver the session.

Welcome,

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. 

As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team.

Along with the video of the presentation, this document will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions &
code.

## Session overview 

Here is a summary of the selected slides:

### Session Flow:

**Introduction:** Brief overview of Generative AI models and the importance of choosing the right model for specific tasks.

**Types of Generative AI Models:** Discussion on LLMs, SLMs, proprietary vs. open, cloud-based vs. on-device, and multi-modal models. Includes a demo comparing SLMs vs. LLMs and inference using text and vision.

**Common Scenarios and Processes:** Criteria to help guide towards the right model, including task requirements, model capabilities, performance metrics, evaluation methods, iterative refinement, and validation processes. Includes a demo on fine-tuning using local and cloud resources.

**Tools for Model Evaluation and Comparison:** Azure ML for model accuracy measurement, industry-standard evaluation metrics for different model types, and experimentation and validation techniques for model selection.

**Case Studies:** Examples of successful model applications and lessons learned from deployment. Includes a demo of the .NET Aspire RAG Solution.

**Conclusion:** Recap of key points and final thoughts on the future of Generative AI models.

**Session Goals:** Provide a comprehensive understanding of Generative AI models, their types, and the criteria for selecting the right model for specific tasks.

**Demos:** Demonstrate AIâ€™s integration with Azure services, enhancing cloud management and sales engagement.

**Key Audience Takeaways:** Grasp the essentials of Generative AI models, including the importance of model selection for specific tasks and the differences between various model types. Learn about the criteria for choosing the right model and discover tools for model evaluation. Gain real-world insights into model applications and optimization techniques through case studies.

# Getting Started
1.  Read document in its entirety.
2.  Watch the video presentation
3.  Ask questions of the Lead Presenter

## Required Quota

The majority of the demos can be run directly with the codespaces environment 
 
>**What's Here?** The quota required to deploy **one instance** of this application. More quota may be necessary if multiple speakers deliver the same content at the same time.
